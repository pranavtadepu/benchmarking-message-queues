# Benchmarking Message Queues & Microservices Performance

## üìã Overview

This repository contains materials focusing on distributed systems architecture, specifically message queues and microservices performance in cloud environments.

## üìö Contents

### 1. **Message Queues.pdf**
Presentation slides covering benchmarking methodologies and performance analysis of message queue systems. This presentation explores:
- Message queue architectures and patterns
- Benchmarking methodologies for distributed messaging systems
- Performance metrics and evaluation criteria
- Comparative analysis of popular message queue implementations:
  - **ActiveMQ Artemis**
  - **RabbitMQ**
  - **Apache Kafka**
  - **Redis**
- Best practices and recommendations

### 2. **Performance_Scalability_of_microservice_architecture_in_cloud_environments.pdf**
A comprehensive review paper examining the performance and scalability aspects of microservices architecture in cloud computing environments. This paper covers:
- Microservices architectural patterns and principles
- Performance considerations in cloud-native applications
- Scalability challenges and solutions
